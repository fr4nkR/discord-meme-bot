Like, the name alone should make it obvious that this sub isn't serious, let alone the sidebar, posts, rules, comments, and everything else.\n\nIf you come here asking us to help you do something illegal, **you'll be banned**. That's not a new rule or anything, and I'd hope all our lovely subscribers and/or anyone with common fucking sense, would already know this. \n\nAbove all though, if you come here onto a social media site based in the US that tries to make a profit, and ask about how to literally commit felonies (ie things that the government don't like and by extension the companies trying not to piss off the government don't like), expecting to actually get answers... You're just *really, really dumb*. And I'm sorry that you have to live with that affliction.\n\n/rj also come on everyone should already know basic IP tree back encryption inversion, which is more than enough to hack into the Python BIOS override, and from there it's a basic matter of just CPU flipping the SQL rainbow tables and reverting the site's MAC trackers back at them, allowing you access to whatever account you want.
